                                class="read-more-target"> Here are some details about the operation itself:
                                Operation Plan
                                Operation Cyclone was developed in 1980 by a team of CIA experts who worked closely with
                                the Pakistani intelligence service (ISI). The plan involved supplying the mujahideen
                                with weapons, ammunition, and other assistance, as well as training them in military

                                matters.
                                Weapons Supply
                                The CIA supplied the mujahideen with weapons and ammunition through the Pakistani
                                border. The main

                                suppliers of weapons were the United States, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia. The weapons
                                included:
                                Machine guns
                                Sniper rifles
                                Rocket launchers
                                Mortars
                                Artillery guns
                                Mujahideen Training
                                The CIA also trained the mujahideen in military matters, including tactics, strategy,
                                and the use of

                                weapons. The training was conducted at secret camps in Pakistan and Afghanistan.
                                Funding
                                Operation Cyclone was funded by the CIA and the Pakistani intelligence service (ISI).
                                Funding was also provided by Saudi Arabia and other countries.
                                The Role of Pakistani Intelligence
                                Pakistani Intelligence (ISI) played a key role in Operation Cyclone. ISI
                                provided the CIA with information on the Soviet troops and the mujahideen, and helped in
                                supplying weapons and training the mujahideen.
                                The Role of Saudi Intelligence
                                Saudi Intelligence also played an important role in Operation Cyclone. Saudi
                                Intelligence
                                provided the CIA with information on the Soviet troops and the mujahideen, and helped in
                                funding the operation.
                                Results of the Operation
                                Operation Cyclone was successful in achieving its goals. Soviet troops were forced to
                                leave Afghanistan in 1989, and the mujahideen were able to establish control over the
                                country. However, the operation also had negative consequences. The mujahideen supported
                                by the CIA were often linked to radical Islamist groups that later became terrorist
                                organizations such as al-Qaeda.</span></li>
