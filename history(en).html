                <h2>Sequence of events</h2>
                <p>The Cold War is a special type of interstate conflict with a tough ideological, economic and
                    military-political confrontation between different socio-political systems. The term "cold war" is
                    used primarily to denote the historical period in international relations in the second half of the
                    20th century between the military-political blocs led by the USSR and the USA. The beginning of the
                    Cold War between the USSR and the USA is usually counted from 1946.</p>

                <p>Simply put, this is a political-economic, military and ideological confrontation between two systems
                    - socialist and capitalist, balancing on the brink of open conflict. </p>
                <p>Or, as the famous British writer George Orwell would say here, it is "a world that is not a world."
                    And if we take the Soviet-American conflict of the 20th century, it can be called the struggle
                    between capitalism and socialism or, more broadly, a non-military confrontation between two systems
                    or powers.</p>
                <h2>Prerequisites for the conflict</h2>
                <p>The Second World War significantly changed the balance of power in the world, which was no longer
                    Eurocentric. Germany and Japan were defeated. The positions of England and France were significantly
                    weakened.</p>
                <p>Only one Western power emerged from the war stronger than it entered the conflict.
                    The United States of America did not wage war on its own territory, and so its cities remained
                    unharmed. Even the human losses were small compared to those of other countries. But the war led to
                    a boom in the American military industry and made other countries of the world dependent on
                    exports from the United States.</p>

                <p>In 1945, the US share of Western industrial output was nearly two-thirds - about a third of world
                    exports of goods. American banks concentrated more than half of the Western world's gold reserves.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Soviet Union became the second post-war superpower. The USSR's enormous contribution to the
                    victory over Nazi Germany evoked sympathy for it in the West and support for communists in various
                    countries.</p>

                <p>Thus, after the war, the Soviet Union gained dominant military-political and economic influence in
                    Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and Albania. And with the liberation
                    of China and North Korea from fascism and Japanese militarism by the Soviet army, the USSR had
                    influence in these countries as well.</p>
                <h2>Causes of Global Tension</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fear. The victorious superpowers, the USA and the USSR, after World War II were rightly afraid
                        of each other's growing influence on other countries. Mutual fears soon turned into a struggle
                        for spheres of influence and a furious rivalry for the status of the sole superpower.</li>
                    <li>Resources. Economic growth requires the exchange of raw materials and final products of all
                        forms of consumption.
                        Therefore, both the USSR and the USA fought for markets for the turnover of their own and other
                        people's resources. Having control over
                        the territory of other countries, they could control other people's resources, including such
                        important ones as
                        oil, gas and minerals. Even if a superpower could not dispose of all the benefits of
                        "partners", it kept them outside the influence of a competitor.</li>
                    <li>Ideological conflict. The antagonism between capitalist America and the socialist Soviet Union
                        made them temporary allies at best. The ideological contradictions between the two models of
                        society - socialist and capitalist - were insurmountable.</li>
                </ul>

                    Minister Otto Grotewohl, 1949</span>
                <h2>Opponents in the Cold War</h2>
                <p>The victorious superpowers, both the Soviet Union and America, had enormous influence in the world.
                    Ideological contradictions added fuel to the fire of fear of communist (for the USA) or imperialist
                    (for the USSR) expansion.</p>
                <p>
                    On April 4, 1949, at the initiative of the United States and Canada, a military-political bloc was
                    created in Washington, called the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). There were initially
                    twelve countries that signed the agreement: Belgium, Great Britain, Denmark, Iceland, Italy, Canada,
                    Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the United States, and France. The stated goal of the
                    bloc was "strengthening stability and increasing prosperity in the North Atlantic region."</p>
                <p>In response to this, the Soviet Union created its own organization from the countries of the
                    socialist camp. On May 14, 1955, in Warsaw, the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual
                    Assistance was signed between representatives of Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, the GDR, Poland,
                    Romania, the USSR, and Czechoslovakia. This military alliance was called the Warsaw Pact
                    Organization (WP). The participating states pledged to provide assistance to each other in the event
                    of an attack. Units of the Soviet army appeared on the territories of the bloc.</p>
                <p>Thus, the greater part of the world was split into two opposing camps - capitalist and socialist.
                    This circumstance determined the entire world politics for many decades.
                    The established concept of "two camps" in the West contributed to the idea of ​​the USSR as a source
                    of threat. They saw in the Warsaw Pact countries a potential aggressor, ready to attack and conquer
                    Western Europe.
                    And although the socialist bloc, headed by the USSR, invariably advocated peaceful coexistence, for
                    them the USA was the camp of imperialism, pursuing a policy of violence against peoples.</p>

                <h2>Expressions of opposition</h2>
                <p>The global conflict manifested itself in many ways.
                    The superpowers promoted their way of life and worldview - capitalist or communist. And they sought
                    to support the corresponding regime in other countries.</p>
                <p>
                    The actions of the superpowers will be clearer if we remember that the main goal in the Cold War is
                    to have a long-term negative impact on the enemy. For example, in attempts to undermine another's
                    economy and force the opponent to work to the point of exhaustion. Or to deprive the enemy
                    government of popular support.
                </p>
                <p>Thus, the Cold War spurred both blocs:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>constantly increase their military budgets;</li>
                    <li>focus on developing defense tools;</li>
                    <li>create increasingly sophisticated types of weapons;</li>
                    <li>preserve ideological postulates.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In the pursuit of resources, both the US and the USSR wanted to expand their influence as far as
                    possible. The struggle was on all fronts to win supporters, in the arms race and in the quest to
                    achieve better economic indicators to demonstrate to the opponent the superiority of their system.
                </p>
                <p>The main manifestations of the Cold War:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>open ideological confrontation;</li>
                    <li>harsh propaganda and information warfare;</li>
                    <li>creation of military-political blocs (NATO and Warsaw Pact);</li>
                    <li>arms race;</li>
                    <li>minimum economic and humanitarian contacts between blocs;</li>
                    <li>construction of numerous military bases in allied countries;</li>
                    <li>deliberate demonstration of force to strengthen one's authority and intimidate the enemy;</li>
                    <li>constant readiness for open military conflict;</li>
                    <li>police functions of one's armed forces;</li>
                    <li>huge military spending.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The image of the enemy that emerged in each of the blocs played a key role in this confrontation.
                    Historians note that it was important for the superpowers not only to establish themselves in the
                    international arena,
                    but also to find support for their foreign policy among their citizens. To form the necessary
                    opinion,
                    the media (the press, and then television), art (especially cinema),
                    literature and school education were used. In this sense, the USSR and the USA were a "mirror" for
                    each other.</p>
                <p>Both superpowers, inspired by their victory in World War II, declared their claims to
                    world domination. Their mutual phobias determined their foreign and domestic policies. At the same
                    time, in the USSR,
                    the military threat was a permanent state.</p>
                <p>This fear was not unfounded. Klaus Naumann, Chairman of the NATO Military Committee in the mid-1990s,
                    noted in a 1995 interview with the Polish socio-political magazine Wprost: "During the Cold War,
                    NATO command posts were in constant readiness to conduct a massive offensive throughout Europe."</p>
                <h2>The Nuclear Deterrence Factor in the Cold War</h2>
                <p>The emergence of nuclear weapons determined many events in the second half of the 20th century. It
                    also led to such a phenomenon as "nuclear deterrence." The founder of neoliberal international
                    relations theory, Kenneth Waltz, noted that thanks to the atomic bomb, the balance of power between
                    the superpowers was maintained mainly by their national armed forces, and not by their allies.</p>
                <h2>Main periods of the Cold War</h2>
                <p>The Cold War has a clearly defined chronological framework - from 1946 to 1991. But the first step
                    towards confrontation was made in the summer of 1945 at the Potsdam Conference. This meeting was
                    attended by the allies of the anti-Hitler coalition - the heads of state and government of the USA,
                    England and the USSR. They gathered to discuss issues of a peaceful post-war structure for Europe.
                </p>
                <p>At the same time as this conference, the first tests of the atomic bomb were taking place in America.
                    As soon as he learned that they had been successful, US President Harry Truman ordered the immediate
                    use of the new weapon against Japan.</p>
                <p>The atomic bombing of the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in early August 1946 was not
                    simply a military operation to hasten Japan's surrender. Another goal was to demonstrate the
                    capabilities of the bombs to the USSR, whose international prestige had greatly increased after the
                    victory over Germany.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Soviet Union regarded this demonstration as a threat to its national security. It made every
                    effort to improve its weapons and undermine the US nuclear monopoly.</p>
                <p>On August 29, 1949, at the test site near Semipalatinsk, the USSR conducted a test nuclear explosion
                    and thus entered the atomic era. This first Soviet nuclear bomb was called RDS-1 — Stalin-1 jet
                    engine.</p>

                <h2>The Beginning of the Cold War (1946–1953)</h2>
                <p>According to historians, the Cold War began with a policy speech by the leader of the victorious
                    country in

                    World War II. But whose speech it was — the leader of Great Britain or the Soviet Union — is where
                    the researchers' opinions differ.</p>
                <p>The first version. The formal beginning of the Cold War was the speech of the leader of the British
                    Conservatives, Winston

                    Churchill, on March 5, 1946, in Fulton (USA).</p>
                <p>Shortly before this, Churchill lost the parliamentary elections in Great Britain and resigned. In
                    Fulton, he accused the USSR of aggression and declared the need for Western countries to join an
                    alliance to
                    fight world communism:</p>
                <p>In essence, here Churchill acted as the ideologist of the Cold War. The Fulton speech became the
                    manifesto of this
                    conflict.</p>
                <p>The second version. In Western historiography, the main event indicating the beginning of the crisis
                    in relations
                    between the USSR and the USA is considered to be the speech of the General Secretary of the CPSU
                    Central Committee Joseph Stalin on February 9, 1946.
                    He delivered it at the Bolshoi Theater at a pre-election meeting of voters. Probably, Western
                    researchers saw the prospect of a new armed conflict in the words:</p>
                <p>There are other points of view that attribute the beginning of the "cold

                <ol>
                    <li>The Korean War was a conflict between North Korea, supported by China and the Soviet Union, and
                        South Korea, supported by the United States and other UN members.</li>
                    <li>Causes of the war</li>
                    <li>The war began on June 25, 1950, when North Korea invaded South Korea with the goal of

                        unifying the Korean Peninsula under its rule. This was due to North Korea's desire to create a
                        unified Korean state and spread communist ideology throughout the entire peninsula.</li>
                    <li>Course of the War</li>
                    <li>The war was fought on several fronts, including battles in Busan, Inchon, and Chosin. The United
                        States and other UN members entered the war on the side of South Korea, providing it with
                        military and economic aid.</li>
                    <li>Results of the War</li>
                    <li>The war ended with the signing of an armistice on July 27, 1953, establishing a demilitarized
                        zone between North and South Korea. However, no formal peace treaty was signed, and the conflict
                        between North and South Korea remains unresolved to this day.</li>
                    <li>Consequences of the war</li>
                    <li>The war had significant consequences for the region and the world, including:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>More than 2 million dead</li>

                <ol>
                    <li>The Arab–Israeli War of 1948–49: The Israeli War of Independence, began after Israel declared
                        independence on May 14, 1948. The war was fought between Israel and a coalition of Arab states,
                        including Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq. Israel was able to repel the Arab attacks and
                        maintain its independence.</li>
                    <li>The Suez Crisis of 1956: Israel, France, and Britain jointly attacked Egypt to retake control of
                        the Suez Canal, which had been nationalized by Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser. The war
                        ended with the withdrawal of troops and the restoration of the Suez Canal's status as an
                        international zone.</li>

                    <li>The Six-Day War of 1967: Israel launched a preemptive strike against Egypt, Syria, and

                        Jordan, resulting in a quick Israeli victory and the capture of the Golan Heights, the West
                        Bank, and

                        the Gaza Strip. The war ended with a ceasefire, but no formal peace treaty was signed.</li>

                    <li>The War of Attrition of 1967-1970: Egypt launched a campaign of attrition against Israel along
                        the

                        Suez Canal, including artillery bombardments and commando raids. The war ended with a ceasefire,
                        but no formal peace treaty was signed.

                    </li>
                    <li>The Yom Kippur War of 1973: Egypt and Syria jointly attacked Israel on the Jewish holiday of Yom
                        Kippur. The war ended with a ceasefire, but no formal peace treaty was signed.</li>
                    <li>1982 Lebanon War: Israel invaded Lebanon to expel the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)
                        from the country. The war ended with the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon, but the PLO was forced
                        to leave Lebanon and move to Tunisia.</li>
                    <li>These conflicts had significant consequences for the region, including:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The displacement of Palestinian refugees</li>

                    </ul>
                    <li>These conflicts also led to a number of important events, including:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The signing of the Camp David Accords between Israel and Egypt in 1978</li>
                        <li>The signing of the Israel-Jordan peace treaty in 1994</li>

                <h2>Incomplete reduction of the conflict (1953–1962)</h2>
                <p>After Stalin's death in March 1953, some warming in relations between the blocs was outlined.
                    Already in 1955, the head of the CPSU Central Committee Nikita Khrushchev took part in the Geneva
                    Conference, the goal of which was to reduce international tensions. Soon after, speaking at the 20th
                    Congress of the CPSU, Khrushchev
                    declared the possibility of peaceful coexistence of the capitalist and socialist systems.</p>
                <p>
                    Despite the desire for détente, tensions between the countries did not subside. The arms race showed
                    no signs of slowing down.</p>

                <img src="img/h_5.jpg" alt="">
                <span>On Red Square in Moscow in 1961</span>

                <p>Both the USA and the USSR continued to invent new means of destroying the enemy. America relied on
                    strategic bombers, the Soviet Union on ballistic missiles. In 1957, the USSR launched its first
                    nuclear submarine.</p>
                <p>In 1956, with Khrushchev's new course of exposing Stalin's personality cult, unrest began in the
                    socialist bloc, which the USSR had to suppress by force.</p>
                <p>
                    In 1961, the Second Berlin Crisis occurred, when the leadership of the GDR got tired of watching its
                    population flee to the West through East Berlin.</p>
                <p>
                    The exodus from the GDR grew, and by 1961 it reached 2.5 million emigrants. To solve this problem,
                    the GDR authorities
                    built a concrete wall between West Berlin and Berlin, the capital of the GDR.
                    This wall became one of the most striking symbols of the Cold War.</p>

                <p>The summer and fall of 1962 were marked by the real threat of a third world war due to the Cuban
                    Missile Crisis.</p>
                <p>The crisis began when the Soviet Union decided to deploy nuclear weapons in Cuba. Missiles with
                    nuclear warheads were transferred to Cuba as a response to the deployment of American missiles in
                    Turkey, Great Britain, and Italy. In addition, in 1961, a socialist government came to power in
                    Cuba, and this circumstance caused the threat of an American invasion of the island.</p>
                <p>But in the next few days, this crisis was peacefully resolved. The USSR agreed to remove missiles
                    from Cuba, and the US abandoned plans to invade the island and removed its missiles from Turkey and
                    Italy.</p>

                <h2>The Vietnam War</h2>
                <p>On March 2, 1965, the US began regular bombing of North Vietnam — the air operation "Rolling
                    Thunder". Read more about the Vietnam War of 1964-1975 in the RIA Novosti reference.</p>
                <p>The Vietnam War of 1964-1975 became one of the most important events of the Cold War. Its course and
                    results largely predetermined the further development of events throughout Southeast Asia.</p>
                <p>The armed struggle in Indochina lasted more than 14 years, from the end of 1960 to April 30, 1975.
                    Direct US military intervention in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam lasted for more than eight
                    years. Military operations also took place in a number of areas of Laos and Cambodia.</p>
                <p>
                    After the end of the Vietnam War of 1945-1954, the national liberation struggle for reunification
                    with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) expanded in the south of the country. The government
                    deployed significant forces created with US assistance to suppress the insurgency.
                    Since the fall of 1959, guerrilla warfare has intensified; by the end of 1960, the rebels had
                    liberated 1/3 of the territory of South Vietnam. In December 1960, the National Front for the
                    Liberation of South Vietnam (NLF) was formed, in February 1961, the Liberation Army (AO SE) and
                    local territorial troops were created, which successfully operated against the Armed Forces of the
                    Republic of Vietnam and the American troops that had been supporting them since 1962. By mid-1964,
                    they controlled 2/3 of the country's territory. In order to preserve the Saigon regime, the United
                    States moved to direct military intervention.</p>

                <h2>Détente (1962–1979)</h2>
                <p>Having narrowly avoided nuclear war during the Cuban Missile Crisis, the leaders of the United States
                    and the Soviet Union tried to learn from mistakes that could have led to irreversible consequences.
                    In 1963, a direct line of communication was established between the White House and the Kremlin.</p>
                <p>
                    That same year, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Great Britain signed a treaty banning
                    nuclear weapons testing in the atmosphere and under water. In the late 1960s, the Soviet Union and
                    the United States began bilateral negotiations on the limitation of strategic weapons, and in 1968
                    they signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.</p>

                    That same year, the United States, the USSR, and Great Britain signed a treaty banning atmospheric
                    and underwater nuclear weapons testing. In the late 1960s, the USSR and the United States began a
                    process of bilateral negotiations on the limitation of strategic weapons, and in 1968 they signed a
                    treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.</span>

                <p>This process of easing international tensions culminated in 1975, when in Helsinki, the heads of 33
                    European states, the United States, and Canada signed an act recognizing the post-war political and
                    territorial changes in Europe and confirming their readiness to resolve disputes peacefully.</p>
                <p>
                    Despite all these initiatives, the world has not become safer. The Cold War then echoed in the
                    bloody Battle of Vietnam</p>
                <h2>Afghanistan Crisis (1979–1989)</h2>
                <p>A new stage of confrontation in the Cold War coincided with the Afghan War (1979–1989).
                    The Soviet government sent troops to Afghanistan to support the pro-communist regime. Assessments of
                    this
                    war vary, but most historians, political scientists, and even Russian President
                    Vladimir Putin noted that the USSR made irreparable political mistakes then.</p>

                <p>Soviet-American relations reached a very dangerous point in 1983, when US President

                    Ronald Reagan declared the USSR an "evil empire." He did this to justify to the American public the
                    escalation of the arms race, and adopted the Strategic Defense Initiative program.
                    All efforts at détente went down the drain in an instant.</p>
                <p>
                    Both the US and the USSR deployed their latest missiles in Europe, pointing them at each other. The
                    world again

                    approached the brink of World War III. Tensions reached such a peak that even a failure in the
                    warning system
                    could lead to a "hot" war.</p>
                <p>
                    According to Wojciech Jaruzelski, Polish Prime Minister and President, by the mid-1980s,
                    the economic and social consequences of the arms race had become increasingly obvious, especially in
                    the USSR.
                    It became clear that this could not continue.</p>
                <p> In April 1985, General Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee Mikhail Gorbachev voiced the opinion
                    that this spiral of arms
                    needed to be slowed down. He came up with the concept of "new thinking" and proposed to put
                    "socialist pluralism" and "the priority of universal human values ​​over class values."</p>
                <p>
                    On Gorbachev's initiative, the first steps towards normalizing relations were taken in 1985. Since
                    1987, the ideological and military-political confrontation between the United States and the USSR
                    initially lost its intensity, and in the next 2-3 years the confrontation almost came to naught.</p>
                <h2>The End of the Cold War (1989-1991)</h2>
                <p>During the decades of the Cold War, significant problems accumulated in the Soviet economy and
                    finances. But the decisive factor in ending the Cold War was the change in the socio-political
                    situation in the Soviet Union during the years of perestroika.</p>
                <p>In the fall of 1989, a wave of coups d'état swept across Central and Eastern Europe. These

                    events took place despite the fact that the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact still existed, and the
                    Soviet army was on the territory of the allied countries. In just a few months, pro-Soviet

                    communist regimes ceased to exist. Everywhere except Romania, these revolutions were peaceful, for
                    which they were called "velvet".</p>
                <p>This was the starting point for the end of more than 40 years of confrontation. The leaders of the
                    United States, Western and Eastern Europe realized that the USSR would not defend socialism in the
                    Eastern European countries "from external and internal enemies." First of all, because there was no
                    reaction from the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>
                    The perception of yesterday's enemies about each other also changed. In 1989, polls revealed one of
                    the best

                    indicators of positive assessments of the USSR/Russia among Americans - 62% against 29% of negative
                    assessments. American foreign policy historian Michael Hogan noted in his book The End of the Cold
                    War that "the destruction of the Berlin Wall in late 1989 marked the beginning of the destruction of
                    an era of ideological and geopolitical struggle between the Soviet Union and the United States,
                    Russia and the West."</p>
                <p>In October 1990, Germany was reunified. Another important step toward ending the Cold War

                    was taken on December 4, 1989. The leaders of Bulgaria, Hungary, East Germany, Poland, and the
                    Soviet Union

                    made a joint statement. They condemned the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, calling those
                    events "an unlawful act of interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state."</p>

                <p>An agreement in principle was reached to end the confrontation between the West and the East. In
                    December 1989, at a meeting in Malta, the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union declared
                    the end of the Cold War. On July 1, 1991, the Warsaw Pact was dissolved, and December 25, 1991, was
                    the last day of the Soviet Union. In his last address, Gorbachev summed up:</p>
                <h2>Results and consequences of the Cold War</h2>
                <p>The Cold War with its global confrontation destroyed the hopes of millions of
                    countries for peaceful cooperation. According to historians, the military-political confrontation of
                    the blocs was a gigantic mistake,
                    costing the world enormous tension, enormous material and human losses.</p>
                <p>At the same time, as experts believe, one of the key problems of both sides during the Cold War was
                    the
                    actual lack of strategy.</p>
                <p>
                    The Cold War as a global conflict was something new for both the Soviet and
                    American elites. Nevertheless, under these conditions, the USSR was able to achieve significant
                    success. Having obviously fewer resources and worse starting conditions, Moscow not only withstood
                    the forty-five-year
                    confrontation, but even sometimes went on the counteroffensive.</p>
                <p>Today, historians point out that it was not the "velvet" revolutions in the countries of the
                    socialist bloc that became the event that ended the Soviet-American confrontation. The Soviet
                    government did not want to hold on to these states.</p>
                <p>The end of the USSR was not initially associated with its defeat in the Cold War. According to the
                    assessment of the
                    Doctor of Historical Sciences Igor Uznarodov, this event can even be called the suicide of the
                    government,
                    because it was not directly connected with the struggle between the West and the East and was a
                    consequence of the internal
                    development of events and the struggle for leadership between different groups of the party elite.
                </p>

                <h2>For the USSR (and Russia)</h2>
                <p>The Cold War ended as a result of the efforts of both sides, but this would not have happened without
                    the change
                    of leadership in the USSR and Gorbachev's new policy. It is unknown how long the confrontation would
                    have lasted and
                    how it would have ended. Historians emphasize that Russia paid too high a price for the end of the
                    Cold War, and the United States benefited from it as much as possible by creating a myth of victory
                    over the USSR.</p>
                <h2>For Europe</h2>
                <p>The withdrawal of Soviet troops from the Warsaw Pact countries actually launched the collapse of the
                    socialist bloc in Europe. The peoples of the former socialist camp could now build their lives
                    according to the model of the democratic countries of the West. In fact, this circumstance returned
                    Europe to the center of world politics.
                    It ceased to be a "battlefield" of the two superpowers - at least for some time.</p>
                <h2>For the United States</h2>
                <p>In Western countries, there is an opinion that in the Cold War there was a winner - the United States
                    and a loser - the collapsed Soviet Union. In America, there were even attempts to establish a
                    commemorative sign - a medal "For Victory in the Cold War". This idea was especially popular in
                    American society in the early 1990s. But in 2007, Hillary Clinton proposed awarding this medal to
                    all those who served in the armed forces or worked in US government agencies from September 2, 1945
                    to December 26, 1991. These initiatives did not receive official status.</p>
                <p>
                    After the self-proclaimed victory in the Cold War, the Americans revised their containment strategy
                    and means of military confrontation. Now America faced new threats in terms of national security,
                    namely terrorism.</p>
                <h2>For Asia and Africa</h2>
                <p>In 1989, changes in Europe were bloodless only because the Soviet Union did not want to interfere in
                    what was happening. In China that same year, everything was different: a student demonstration in
                    Tiananmen Square in Beijing was suppressed by tanks. In the West and in dissident circles in China,
                    these demonstrations were called "pro-democracy demonstrations", while official Beijing still talks
                    about those events as an attempt at a "counter-revolutionary rebellion".</p>
                <p>Although the Soviet model of socialism collapsed in the countries of the socialist camp in 1989,
                    those events did not affect socialism as an ideology. In China, North Korea, Vietnam, Mongolia, Cuba
                    and other countries, socialist regimes remained in power. The Cold War is still going on today in
                    the confrontation between two Koreas: South and North.</p>
                <p>With the start of the Cold War, Africa became one of the zones of tough confrontation between the
                    superpowers. The Americans were primarily interested in the potential of mineral resources in
                    African countries. After the collapse of the socialist bloc and the Soviet Union, US expansion on
                    the African continent only intensified.</p>
